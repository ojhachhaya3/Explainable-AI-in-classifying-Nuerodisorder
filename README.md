# Explainable-AI-in-classifying-Nuerodisorder
## Overview
This project aims to build an interpretable machine learning pipeline to classify neurodisorders (e.g., schizophrenia) using EEG signal data. Beyond achieving high classification performance, the core focus is on applying Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to understand why the model makes its decisions â€” enabling trust, transparency, and clinical insight.
